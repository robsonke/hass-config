3.0.5.7
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.5.6 (7/15/2024)
1. ICLOUD3 PROBLEMS WITH HA 2024.7.4 - Fixed
2. ADD/UPDATE DEVICE CONFIGURATION (Fixed) - This was probably caused by HA 2024.7.4 Loading issues.
3. MOBILE APP NOTIFY MESSAGE (Fixed) - A warning message about not being able to send a notification to a device was displayed in the Event Log when the device was not using the Mobile App.


3.0.5.6
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.5.6 (7/15/2024)
1. ICLOUD3 BUG FIXES - Fixes the following errors:
    ```AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'init_step_complete'```
    ```AttributeError: module 'custom_components.icloud3.sensor' has no attribute _setup_recorder_exclude_sensor_filter'```
2. HA ERROR/WARNING MESSAGES - Fixed a problem where some I/O getting directory and filename list for the Update Devices configuration screen was being done outside of the HA Event Loop


3.0.5.5
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.5.5 (7/15/2024)
1. ICLOUD3 FAILED TO LOAD (Fix) - iCloud3 injected special code into the HA history recorder to exclude various sensor entities with large text fields from being added to the history recorder. This caused problems with HA in the 2024.7 release.  The HA 2024.7.2 included special code that blocked iCloud3 from loading. A temporary patch was posted on the iCloud3 GitHub repository to disable the recorder injection. This update is a permant fix.

    All sensor attributes not related to the battery, distance and timer sensors are being added to the HA recorder history database. Text base sensor attributes are not being added (info sensors, Event Log sensor, badge, tracking update, zone, etc.)..

    **SPECIAL NOTE**: If you get an HA error that a sensor attribute is not available, create an issue on the iCloud3 GitHub repository. Let me know the sensor name and attribute name that is causing the error. I will remove it from the exclusion list in the next update.


3.0.5.2
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.5.2 (6/8/2024)
1. HA I/O ERROR FROM EVENT LOOP (Fixed) - HA was complaining about doing I/O (HACS file) outside of the Event Loop. Changed the method of doing I/O to use HA routines for the configuration file, restore state file and HACS file.
2. FROM_ZONE ERROR (Fixed) - Normally the TrackFrom Zone and NextUpdate Zone is the Home zone. Added a check to set it to Home if it had never been set.


3.0.5.1
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.5.1 (5/25/2024)
1. MOBILE APP (Fix) - Fixed a problem where the device's Mobile App data source would be disabled (reset to NotUsed) if the HA Mobile App Integration was set up after the Mobile App's initial locate had been completed.
2. TRANSLATION FILE (new) - Added Chinese (Simplified) translation (@MagicStarTrace)

### Change Log - v3.0.5 (5/18/2024)
1. HACS UPUDATE ALERT (New) - The HACS Integration information will be check on a regular basis to see if a newer version of iCloud3 is available.
2. ICLOUD ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION/FAMSHR DEVICES LIST (Fixed) - During startup ("Stage 4), the iCloud Account access is set up and the devices in the Family Sharing List is read. If a problem occurred, iCloud3 would retry this 10-times to see if the error was corrected. However, the FamShr data was not being reread and the old data was being used. The FamShr data is now reread correctly when trying to recover from this error.
3. UPDATE DEVICES SCREEN (Fixed) - When upgrading a device (iPhone, iPad, Watch) and both the old and new devices are still in the Family Sharing List, the new device was being set back to the old device the next time iCloud3 was started.
4. LOCKED ICLOUD ACCOUNT (New) - An error message is displayed in the HA logs and on the Event Log if the iCloud account is locked.
5. EVENT LOG (Fix) - An 'Unbound event_recd' error would display when the length of the the event text > 2000 characters (@ehendrix23).


v3.0.4
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.4 (5/11/2024)
1. ADD DEVICE (Fixed) - An 'Out of Range' error message was encountered adding the first device.
2. DIRECTION OF TRAVEL (Improvement) - Tweaked the AwayFrom direction override when approaching Home after the previous directions were Towards.
3. Event Type DEPRECIATED EOORO MESSAGE (Fixed) - This was a warning about the removal of the EventType from HA next year. It has been removed.
4. RAWDATA LOGGING - Changed some formatting of the log to better filter device messages.


v3.0.3
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.3 (5/1/2024)
1. ALERTS (New) - An alert message is displayed on the Event Log and in the _alert_ attribute on the device's device_tracker and badge entities until it has been resolved. Examples of alerts are a startup error, no gps data, the device is offline, the battery below 20%, and tracking is paused. The alert attribute can be used in an automation to trigger sending a message to any device using the Mobile App. See the _Reference > Devices and Other Alerts_ chapter in the iCloud3 docs [here](#/chapters/7.6-alerts) for more information and example automations.
2. BATTERY (Improvement) - The battery information attribute has been added to the device's device_tracker and badge entity. It shows the battery level, charging state, when the information was updated and the source of the data. The charging status text has been changed to 'Charged', 'Charging', 'NotCharging', 'Low' and 'Unknown'.
3. UPDATE SENSOR (Fixed) - An 'AttributeError' message has been fixed. It was caused by trying to update the sensor before the sensor had been set up.
4. CONFIGURE SETTINGS > ICLOUD ACCOUNT AND MOBILE APP screen (Fixed) - Changing iCloud account information (Username or password) was not being saved correctly so restarting iCloud3 would still use the old account. A Log Off option was added to initialize the iCloud Account username/password fields.
5. DIRECTION OF TRAVEL (Improvement) - When Driving towards Home, the calculated straight line distance is used to determine the travel direction ('Towards'). The direction would momentarily  change to 'AwayFrom' if the distance from Home increased due to a curve in the road or you were stopped at an intersection. It would then change back to 'Towards' on the next update. In this case, the direction will not be changed and will remain 'Towards'.
6. Other minor code changes, tuning and code cleanup.



v3.0.2 - 3/30/2023
.......................
1. ICLOUD SERVER ERROR MESSAGE (Fixed) - When the iCloud servers did not respond with location information, the 'no response from iCloud servers' error was displayed correctly. This was followed by another unrelated error which should have not been displayed.
2. ALERTS, STARTUP ERRORS, WARNING MESSAGES (New) - Unusual errors or warning events for iPhones, iPads, and Watches are displayed in a green bar on the first line of the Event Log whenthe event occurs. The message will continue displaying until the event is corrected. This includes (1) startup errors, (2) no data received from iCloud Location Servers, (3) when a device is offline and (4) when a device's location is over 5-hours old and (5) when tracking is paused. The messages from AirPods and iPods are only displayed when their Event Log screen is displayed.
3. OTHER - Minor code corrections and cleanup.

v3.0.1.1 - 3/24/2024
.......................
1. ICLOUD-0.LOG FILE (Fixed) - The icloud-0.log file was not being created when the HA 'logger:' statement was not in the HA configuration.yaml file.

v3.0.1 - 3/20/2024
.......................
1. UPDATE SENSOR & DEVICE TRACKER ENTITIES (Improvement) - Changed the method of updating these items at the request of @balloob (Paulus Schousten, HA Founder) to prevent a potential Home Assistant lockup when doing an update.
2. LOG FILE (Improvement) - Changed the method of updating the iCloud3 log files. Also changed some of the record formatting to improve readability.
2. WAZE & CALC DISTANCE SENSORS (Fixed) - They were not being created.
3. UPDATE DEVICES CONFIGURE SCREEN (Fixed) - The Picture parameter was listing every image file in the all of the www/ sub-directories. A filter was added to limit the search to specific directories. The filter is defined on the Tracking and Other Parameters screen. Only the first 25 image files in a directory will be displayed to prevent overloading the HA dropdown list handler.
4. FIXED INTERVAL (Improvement) - The lowest interval was reduced from 5-minutes to 3-minutes.
5. DIRECTION OF TRAVEL (Improvement) - Changed the way this is being updated. If the distance from Home is more than 400m/250mi, it will be set to FarAway.
6. STATIONARY ZONE (Fixed) - The second device to enter an existing Stationary Zone was not saving the Stationary Zone info correctly.

# Rob's Home Assistant Configuration
Welcome to my repository representing all Home Assistant configuration. I'm sharing this to help others, since many such other repositories helped me a lot.
Keeping this up to date is a continuous process, I discover daily new possibilities and face situations that ask for automation.

# Screenshots
Theme used in below screenshots is a custom Dark and Light Theme based on [Matthias' work](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config). I've also used many of his ideas but with again a lot of customisations.
